This method can be useful in improving models when we find that they’re not performing equally well across different slices of our data, which we can identify using [Fairness Indicators](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/fairness_indicators). The second of Google’s AI principles states that our technology should avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias, and we believe this technique can help improve model fairness in some situations. In particular, this notebook will:\n",

These are assumptions made as this information is not mentioned in the [original paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/html/Liu_Deep_Learning_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.html).\n",
