We will show how this workflow can be used to spot potential fairness concerns, independent of the framework one used to construct and train the model. As in this case study, we can analyze the results from any machine learning framework (e.g. TensorFlow, JAX, etc) once they are converted to a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
