        "## COMPAS Dataset\n",
        "[COMPAS](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/compas-recidivism-risk-score-data-and-analysis) (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a public dataset, which contains approximately 18,000 criminal cases from Broward County, Florida between January, 2013 and December, 2014. The data contains information about 11,000 unique defendants, including criminal history demographics, and a risk score intended to represent the defendant’s likelihood of reoffending (recidivism). A machine learning model trained on this data has been used by judges and parole officers to determine whether or not to set bail and whether or not to grant parole. \n",
        "\n",
        "In 2016, [an article published in ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) found that the COMPAS model was  incorrectly predicting that African-American defendants would recidivate at much higher rates than their white counterparts while Caucasian would not recidivate at a much higher rate. For Caucasian defendants, the model made mistakes in the opposite direction, making incorrect predictions that they wouldn’t commit another crime. The authors went on to show that these biases were likely due to an uneven distribution in the data between African-Americans and Caucasian defendants. Specifically, the ground truth label of a negative example (a defendant **would not** commit another crime) and a positive example (defendant **would** commit another crime) were disproportionate between the two races. Since 2016, the COMPAS dataset has appeared frequently in the ML fairness literature \u003csup\u003e1, 2, 3\u003c/sup\u003e, with researchers using it to demonstrate techniques for identifying and remediating fairness concerns. This [tutorial from the FAT* 2018 conference](https://youtu.be/hEThGT-_5ho?t=1) illustrates how COMPAS can dramatically impact a defendant’s prospects in the real world. \n",

        "The walk through of the case study will proceed as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Download the data, preprocess, and explore the initial dataset.\n",
        "2.   Build a TFX pipeline with the COMPAS dataset using a Keras binary classifier.\n",
        "3.   Run our results through TensorFlow Model Analysis, TensorFlow Data Validation, and load Fairness Indicators to explore any potential fairness concerns within our model.\n",
        "4.   Use ML Metadata to track all the artifacts for a model that we trained with TFX.\n",
        "5.   Weight the initial COMPAS dataset for our second model to account for the uneven distribution between recidivism and race.\n",
        "6.   Review the performance changes within the new dataset.\n",
        "7.   Check the underlying changes within our TFX pipeline with ML Metadata to understand what changes were made between the two models. \n",

        "Within this case study we developed a Keras classifier within a TFX pipeline with the COMPAS dataset to examine any fairness concerns within the dataset. After initially developing the TFX, fairness concerns were not immediately apparent until examining the individual slices within our model by our sensitive features --in our case race. After identifying the issues, we were able to track down the source of the fairness issue with TensorFlow DataValidation to identify a method to mitigate the fairness concerns via model weighting while tracking and annotating the changes via ML Metadata. Although we are not able to fully fix all the fairness concerns within the dataset, by adding a note for future developers to follow will allow others to understand and issues we faced while developing this model. \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally it is important to note that this case study did not fix the fairness issues that are present in the COMPAS dataset. By improving the fairness concerns in the model we also reduced the AUC and accuracy in the performance of the model. What we were able to do, however, was build a model that showcased the fairness concerns and track down where the problems could be coming from by tracking or model's lineage while annotating any model concerns within the metadata.\n",
