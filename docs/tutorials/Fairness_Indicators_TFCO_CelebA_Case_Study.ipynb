    "*   CelebA's categorizations do not reflect real human diversity of attributes.\n",
    "*   For the purposes of this notebook, the feature containing the \"Young\" attribute is referred to as \"age group\", where the presence of the \"Young\" attribute in an image is labeled as a member of the \"Young\" age group and the absence of the \"Young\" attribute is labeled as a member of the \"Not Young\" age group. These are assumptions made as this information is not mentioned in the [original paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/html/Liu_Deep_Learning_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.html).\n",
    "*   As such, performance in the models trained in this notebook is tied to the ways the attributes have been operationalized and annotated by the authors of CelebA.\n",
