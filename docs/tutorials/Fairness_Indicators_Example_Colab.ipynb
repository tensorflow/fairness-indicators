        "\n",
        "Fairness Indicators is a suite of tools built on top of [TensorFlow Model Analysis (TFMA)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/model_analysis/get_started) that enable regular evaluation of fairness metrics in product pipelines. TFMA is a library for evaluating both TensorFlow and non-TensorFlow machine learning models. It allows you to evaluate your models on large amounts of data in a distributed manner, compute in-graph and other metrics over different slices of data, and visualize them in notebooks. \n",
        "\n",
        "Fairness Indicators is packaged with [TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/get_started) and the [What-If Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/). Using Fairness Indicators allows you to: \n",
        "\n",
        "* Evaluate model performance, sliced across defined groups of users\n",
        "* Gain confidence about results with confidence intervals and evaluations at multiple thresholds\n",
        "* Evaluate the distribution of datasets\n",
        "* Dive deep into individual slices to explore root causes and opportunities for improvement\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will use Fairness Indicators to fix fairness issues in a model you train using the [Civil Comments dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification). Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHT-ImFXPQo) for more details and context on the real-world scenario this is based on which is also one of primary motivations for creating Fairness Indicators."
