  """Write a Fairness Indicators summary.

  Arguments:
    eval_result_output_dir: Directory output created by
      tfma.model_eval_lib.ExtractEvaluateAndWriteResults API, which contains
      'metrics' file having MetricsForSlice results.
    step: Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If
      omitted, this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must
      not be None.
    description: Optional long-form description for this summary, as a constant
      `str`. Markdown is supported. Defaults to empty.

  Returns:
    True on success, or false if no summary was written because no default
    summary writer was available.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and
      `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()` is None.
